* parallel_pipeling (is currently being developed in it's own branch)

* There is currently no support for Boost libraries (not headers) in a user
  specified location.

* g++ 4.3 parallel_mode support
  => Milestone: 1.2.1

* replace build system, something with '$LIBNAME-config --libs --cflags ...' would be nice

* if the stxxl disk files have been enlarged because more external memory
  was requested by the program, resize them afterwards to
  max(size_at_program_start, configured_size)
  https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4925158

* if no .stxxl file was found and /var/tmp/stxxl was used, remove this file
  at program end (don't hog the disk and allow other users to create and
  use that file, too)

* new types: stxxl::size_type_internal stxxl::size_type_external

* stxxl_timestamp ==> stxxl::timestamp

* integrate unordered_map branch
  => Milestone: 1.3

* doxygen: do not link every occurrence of 'file' do stxxl::file

* interleaved_allocators: provide a constructor that takes a base strategy
  as parameter, not a disk range, and derive desired information from the
  strategy

* implement recursion in stable_ksort and do not assume random key distribution, do sampling instead
