* asynchronous pipelining (currently being developed in branch parallel_pipelining_integration)

* replace build system, something with '$LIBNAME-config --libs --cflags ...' would be nice

* if the stxxl disk files have been enlarged because more external memory
  was requested by the program, resize them afterwards to
  max(size_at_program_start, configured_size)
  https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=4925158

* new types: stxxl::size_type_internal stxxl::size_type_external

* integrate unordered_map branch
  => Milestone: 1.3

* doxygen: do not link every occurrence of 'file' to stxxl::file

* allocation strategies: provide a method get_num_disks()
  and don't use stxxl::config::get_instance()->disks_number() inappropriately

* implement recursion in stable_ksort and do not assume random key
  distribution, do sampling instead
  as a start, at least abort early if the expected size of a bucket is larger
  than the memory available to sort it

* debug stable_ksort in depth, there are still some crashing cases left

* stxxl::debugmon: FIXME! broken design
  - only works properly for blocks from the mng layer, doing I/Os on manually
    allocated memory is expected to fail
  - does not take into account array allocations with metadata overhead
    (either register addresses that are recognized by delete[] or register
    block adresses that are used for I/Os - you can't have both)

* continue using the new approach for STXXL_VERBOSE:
  $(CXX) -DSTXXL_VERBOSE_FOO=STXXL_VERBOSEx

* check+fix all sorted_runs() calls to not cause write I/Os

* on disk destruction, check whether all blocks had been deallocated before,
  i.e. free_bytes == disk_size

* implement an allocator which looks at the available free space on disks
  when distributing blocks to disks

* allow configuration of the block-managed disks using API calls, 
  not only through the configuration file.

* separate library sources and tests/benchmarks
  (e. g. to top level directories src/ and tests/)

* abstract away block manager so every container can attach to a file.
