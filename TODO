* parallel_pipeling (is currently being developed in it's own branch)

* FIXME: README refers to a Section "License Terms" in the manual which is
  missing

* FIXME: there are some FIXME in doxymain.h

* There is currently no support for Boost libraries (not headers) in a user
  specified location.

* BUG: timer::timestamp() is non-monotonic, boost::posix_time::microsec_clock::local_time().time_of_day() resets on midnight

* g++ 4.3 parallel_mode support

* replace build system, something with '$LIBNAME-config --libs --cflags ...' would be nice
