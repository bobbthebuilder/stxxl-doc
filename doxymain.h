 *
 * <BR><BR>
 * The core of \c S<small>TXXL</small> is an implementation of the C++
 * standard template library STL for external memory (out-of-core)
 * computations, i.e., \c S<small>TXXL</small> implements containers and algorithms
 * that can process huge volumes of data that only fit on
 * disks. While the compatibility to the STL supports
 * ease of use and compatibility with existing applications,
 * another design priority is high performance.
 * Here is a selection of \c S<small>TXXL</small> performance features:
 * - transparent support of multiple disks
 * - variable block lengths
 * - overlapping of I/O and computation
 * - prevention of OS file buffering overhead
 * - algorithm pipelining
 *
 *
 * \section platforms Supported Operating Systems
 * - Linux (kernel >= 2.4.18)
 * - Solaris
 * - Mac OS X
 * - other POSIX compatible systems should work, but have not been tested
 * - Windows 2000/XP/Vista
 *
 *
 * \section compilers Supported Compilers
 *
 * The following compilers have been tested in different
 * \c S<small>TXXL</small> configurations.
 * Other compilers might work, too, but we don't have the resources
 * (systems, compilers or time) to test them.
 * Feedback is welcome.
 *
 * The compilers marked with '*' are the developer's favorite choices
 * and are most thoroughly tested.

 * \page FAQ FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions
 *
 * \section FAQ-latest Latest version of this FAQ
 * The most recent version of this FAQ can always be found
 * <a href="http://algo2.iti.uni-karlsruhe.de/dementiev/stxxl/trunk/FAQ.html">here</a>.
 *
 *
 * \section q1 References to Elements in External Memory Data Structures
 *
 * You should not pass or store references to elements in an external memory
 * data structure. When the reference is used, the block that contains the
 * element may be no longer in internal memory.<br>
 * Use/pass an iterator (reference) instead.<br>
 * For an \c stxxl::vector with \c n pages and LRU replacement strategy, it
 * can be guaranteed that the last \c n references
 * obtained using \c stxxl::vector::operator[] or dereferencing
 * an iterator are valid.
 * However, if \c n is 1, even a single innocent-looking line like
 * \verbatim std::cout << v[0] << " " << v[1000000] << std::endl; \endverbatim can lead to
 * inconsistent results.
 * <br>
 *
 *
 * \section q2 Thread-Safety
 *
 * The I/O and block management layers are thread-safe (since release 1.1.1).
 * The user layer data structures are not thread-safe.<br>
 * I.e. you may access <b>different</b> \c S<small>TXXL</small> data structures from concurrent threads without problems,
 * but you should not share a data structure between threads (without implementing proper locking yourself).<br>
 * This is a design choice, having the data structures thread-safe would mean a significant performance loss.
 *
 *
 * \section q3 I have configured several disks to use with STXXL. Why does STXXL fail complaining about the lack of space? According to my calclulations, the space on the disks should be sufficient.
 *
 * This may happen if the disks have different size. With the default parameters \c S<small>TXXL</small> containers use randomized block-to-disk allocation strategies
 * that distribute data evenly between the disks but ignore the availability of free space on them. 
 *

 *
 *
 * \section compile_apps Application compilation
 *
 * After compiling the library, some Makefile variables are written to
 * \c stxxl.mk (\c mcstxxl.mk if you built with MCSTL) in your
 * \c STXXL_ROOT directory. This file should be included from your
 * application's Makefile.
 *
 * The following variables can be used:
 * - \c STXXL_CXX - the compiler used to build the \c S<small>TXXL</small>
 *      library, it's recommended to use the same to build your applications
 * - \c STXXL_CPPFLAGS - add these flags to the compile commands
 * - \c STXXL_LDLIBS - add these libraries to the link commands
 *
 * An example Makefile for an application using \c S<small>TXXL</small>:
 * \verbatim
STXXL_ROOT      ?= .../stxxl
STXXL_CONFIG    ?= stxxl.mk
include $(STXXL_ROOT)/$(STXXL_CONFIG)

# use the variables from stxxl.mk
CXX              = $(STXXL_CXX)
CPPFLAGS        += $(STXXL_CPPFLAGS)

# add your own optimization, warning, debug, ... flags
# (these are *not* set in stxxl.mk)
CPPFLAGS        += -O3 -Wall -g -DFOO=BAR

# build your application
# (my_example.o is generated from my_example.cpp automatically)
my_example.bin: my_example.o
	$(CXX) $(CPPFLAGS) $(CXXFLAGS) my_example.o -o $@ $(STXXL_LDLIBS)
\endverbatim
 *
 * Before you try to run one of the \c S<small>TXXL</small> examples
 * (or your own \c S<small>TXXL</small> program) you must configure the disk
 * space that will be used as external memory for the library. For instructions how to do that,
 * see the next section.
 *
 *
 * \section space Disk space
 *
 * To get best performance with \c S<small>TXXL</small> you should assign separate disks to it.
 * These disks should be used by the library only.
 * Since \c S<small>TXXL</small> is developed to exploit disk parallelism, the performance of your
 * external memory application will increase if you use more than one disk.
 * But from how many disks your application can benefit depends on how "I/O bound" it is.
 * With modern disk bandwidths
 * of about 50-75 MB/s most of applications are I/O bound for one disk. This means that if you add another disk
 * the running time will be halved. Adding more disks might also increase performance significantly.
 *
 *
 * \section filesystem Recommended file system
 *
 * Our library take benefit of direct user memory - disk transfers (direct access) which avoids
 * superfluous copies.
 * We recommend to use the
 * \c XFS file system (<A href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/">link</A>) that
 * gives good read and write performance for large files.
 * Note that file creation speed of \c XFS is slow, so that disk
 * files should be precreated.
 *
 * If the filesystems only use is to store one large \c S<small>TXXL</small> disk file,
 * we also recommend to add the following options to the \c mkfs.xfs command to gain maximum performance:
 * \verbatim -d agcount=1 -l size=512b \endverbatim
 *
 *
 * \section configuration Disk configuration file
 *
 * You must define the disk configuration for an
 * \c S<small>TXXL</small> program in a file named \c '.stxxl' that must reside
 * in the same directory where you execute the program.
 * You can change the default file name for the configuration
 * file by setting the environment variable \c STXXLCFG .
 *
 * Each line of the configuration file describes a disk.
 * A disk description uses the following format:<BR>
 * \c disk=full_disk_filename,capacity,access_method
 *
 * Description of the parameters:
 * - \c full_disk_filename : full disk filename. In order to access disks S<small>TXXL</small> uses file
 *   access methods. Each disk is represented as a file. If you have a disk that is mounted in Unix
 *   to the path /mnt/disk0/, then the correct value for the \c full_disk_filename would be
 *   \c /mnt/disk0/some_file_name ,
 * - \c capacity : maximum capacity of the disk in megabytes
 * - \c access_method : \c S<small>TXXL</small> has a number of different
 *   file access implementations for POSIX systems, choose one of them:
 *   - \c syscall uses \c read and \c write system calls which perform disk transfers directly
 *     on user memory pages without superfluous copying (currently the fastest method)
 *   - \c mmap : performs disks transfers using \c mmap and \c munmap system calls
 *   - \c simdisk : simulates timings of the IBM IC35L080AVVA07 disk, full_disk_filename must point
 *     to a file on a RAM disk partition with sufficient space
 *
 * See also the example configuration file \c 'config_example' included in the tarball.
 *
 *
 * \section logfiles Log files
 *
 * \c S<small>TXXL</small> produces two kinds of log files, a message and an error log.
 * By setting the environment variables \c STXXLLOGFILE and \c STXXLERRLOGFILE, you can configure
 * the location of these files.
 * The default values are \c stxxl.log and \c stxxl.errlog, respectively.
 *
 *
 * \section excreation Precreating external memory files
 *
 * In order to get the maximum performance one should precreate disk files described in the configuration file,
 * before running \c S<small>TXXL</small> applications.
 *
 * The precreation utility is included in the set of \c S<small>TXXL</small>
 * utilities ( \c utils/createdisks.bin ). Run this utility
 * for each disk you have defined in the disk configuration file:
 * \verbatim utils/createdisks.bin capacity full_disk_filename... \endverbatim

 *
 *
 * \section compile_apps Application compilation
 *
 * Programs using Stxxl can be compiled using options from \c compiler.options
 * file (in the \c STXXL_ROOT directory). The linking options for the VC++
 * linker you can find in \c linker.options file. In order to accomplish this
 * do the following:
 * - Open project property pages (menu Project->Properties)
 * - Choose C/C++->Command Line page.
 * - In the 'Additional Options' field insert the contents of the \c compiler.options file.
 * Make sure that the Runtime libraries/debug options (/MDd or /MD or /MT or /MTd) of
 * the \c Stxxl library (see above) do not conflict with the options of your project.
 * Use the same options in the \c Stxxl and your project.
 * - Choose Linker->Command Line page.
 * - In the 'Additional Options' field insert the contents of the \c linker.options file.
 *
 * <BR>
 * If you use make files you can
 * include \c make.settings file in your make files and use \c STXXL_COMPILER_OPTIONS and
 * \c STXXL_LINKER_OPTIONS variables, defined therein.
 *
 * For example: <BR>
 * \verbatim cl -c my_example.cpp $(STXXL_COMPILER_OPTIONS) \endverbatim <BR>
 * \verbatim link my_example.obj /out:my_example.exe $(STXXL_LINKER_OPTIONS) \endverbatim
 *
 * <BR>
 * The \c STXXL_ROOT\\test\\WinGUI directory contains an example MFC GUI project
 * that uses \c Stxxl. In order to compile it open the WinGUI.vcproj file in
 * Visual Studio .NET. Change if needed the Compiler and Linker Options of the project
 * (see above).
 *
 * Before you try to run one of the \c S<small>TXXL</small> examples

 *
 * \section download Download and library compilation
 *
 * - Download stxxl_0.77.tgz from
 *   <A href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=131632&package_id=144407&release_id=541515">SourceForge</A>.
 * - Unpack in some directory executing: \c tar \c zfxv \c stxxl_0.77.tgz ,
 * - Change to \c stxxl directory: \c cd \c stxxl ,
 * - Change file \c compiler.make according to your system configuration
 *   - name of your make program
 *   - name of your compiler
 *   - \c S<small>TXXL</small> root directory ( \c directory_where_you_unpacked_the_tar_ball/stxxl )
 * - Run: \verbatim make lib \endverbatim
 * - Run: \verbatim make tests \endverbatim (optional, if you want to run some test programs)
 *
 * In your makefiles of programs that will use \c S<small>TXXL</small> you should include
 * the file \c compiler.make
 * file (add the line 'include ../compiler.make') because it contains a useful variable (STXXL_VARS)
 * that includes all compiler definitions and library paths that you need to compile an
 * \c S<small>TXXL</small> program.
 *
 * For example: <BR> \verbatim g++  my_example.cpp -o my_example -g $(STXXL_VARS) \endverbatim
 *
 * Before you try to run one of the \c S<small>TXXL</small> examples
 * (or your \c S<small>TXXL</small> program) you must configure the disk
 * space that will be used as external memory for the library. See the next section.
 *
 *
 * \section space Disk space
 *
 * To get best performance with \c S<small>TXXL</small> you should assign separate disks to it.
 * These disks should be used by the library only.
 * Since \c S<small>TXXL</small> is developed to exploit disk parallelism, the performance of your
 * external memory application will increase if you use more than one disk.
 * But from how many disks your application can benefit depends on how "I/O bound" it is.
 * With modern disk bandwidths
 * of about 50-75 MB/s most of applications are I/O bound for one disk. This means that if you add another disk
 * the running time will be halved. Adding more disks might also increase performance significantly.
 *
 *
 * \section filesystem Recommended file system
 *
 * Our library take benefit of direct user memory - disk transfers (direct access) which avoids
 * superfluous copies. This method has some disadvantages when accessing files on \c ext2 partitions.
 * Namely one requires one byte of internal memory per each accessed kilobyte of file space. For external
 * memory applications with large inputs this could be not proper. Therefore we recommend to use the
 * \c XFS file system <A href="http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/">link</A> which does not have this overhead but
 * gives the same read and write performance. Note that file creation speed of \c XFS is slow, so that disk
 * files must be precreated.
 *
 *
 * \section configuration Disk configuration file
 *
 * You must define the disk configuration for an
 * \c S<small>TXXL</small> program in a file named \c '.stxxl' that must reside
 * in the same directory where you execute the program.
 * You can change the default file name for the configuration
 * file by setting the environment variable \c STXXLCFG .
 *
 * Each line of the configuration file describes a disk.
 * A disk description uses the following format:<BR>
 * \c disk=full_disk_filename,capacity,access_method
 *
 * Description of the parameters:
 * - \c full_disk_filename : full disk filename. In order to access disks S<small>TXXL</small> uses file
 *   access methods. Each disk is represented as a file. If you have a disk that is mounted in Unix
 *   to the path /mnt/disk0/, then the correct value for the \c full_disk_filename would be
 *   \c /mnt/disk0/some_file_name ,
 * - \c capacity : maximum capacity of the disk in megabytes
 * - \c access_method : \c S<small>TXXL</small> has a number of different
 *   file access implementations for POSIX systems, choose one of them:
 *   - \c syscall uses \c read and \c write system calls which perform disk transfers directly
 *     on user memory pages without superfluous copying (currently the fastest method)
 *   - \c mmap : performs disks transfers using \c mmap and \c munmap system calls
 *   - \c simdisk : simulates timings of the IBM IC35L080AVVA07 disk, full_disk_filename must point
 *     to a file on a RAM disk partition with sufficient space
 *
 * See also the example configuration file \c 'config_example' included in the tarball.

 *
 * \section checkout Retrieving the source from subversion
 *
 * The \c S<small>TXXL</small> sourcecode is available in a subversion repository on sourceforge.net.<br>
 * To learn more about subversion and (command line and graphical) subversion clients
 * visit <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a>.
 *
 * The main development line (in subversion called the "trunk") is located at
 * \c https://stxxl.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/stxxl/trunk
 * <br>Alternatively you might use a branch where a new feature is being developed.
 * Branches have URLs like
 * \c https://stxxl.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/stxxl/branches/foobar
 *
 * For the following example let's assume you want to download the latest trunk version
 * using the command line client and store it in a directory called \c stxxl-trunk
 * (which should not exist, yet).
 * Otherwise replace URL and path to your needs.
 *
 * Run: \verbatim svn checkout https://stxxl.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/stxxl/trunk stxxl-trunk \endverbatim
 * Change to stxxl directory: \verbatim cd stxxl-trunk \endverbatim
 *
 * \section svn_continue_installation Continue Installation
 *
 * Now follow the regular installation and usage instructions,
 * skipping over the tarball download and extraction parts.<br>
 * For the \c STXXL_ROOT variable value choose something like
 * \c \$(HOME)/path/to/stxxl-trunk
 *
 * - \link installation_linux_gcc Installation (Linux/g++) \endlink
 * - \link installation_solaris_gcc Installation (Solaris/g++) \endlink
 * - \link installation_msvc Installation (Windows/MS Visual C++ 8.0) \endlink
 *
 * \section update Updating an existing subversion checkout
 *
 * Once you have checked out the source code you can easily update it to the latest version later on.
 *
 * Change to stxxl directory:
 * \verbatim cd ...path/to/stxxl-trunk \endverbatim
 * Run
 * \verbatim svn update \endverbatim
 * Usually you don't have to reconfigure anything, so just rebuild:
 * - \verbatim make library_g++ \endverbatim
 * - \verbatim make tests_g++ \endverbatim (optional, if you want to compile and run some test programs)
