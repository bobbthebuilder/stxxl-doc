/*! \mainpage Welcome to STXXL

The core of \c S<small>TXXL</small> is an implementation of the C++ standard template library STL for external memory (out-of-core)
computations, i.e., \c S<small>TXXL</small> implements containers and algorithms that can process huge volumes of data that only fit on
disks. While the compatibility to the STL supports  ease of use and compatibility with existing applications,
another design priority is high performance. Here is a selection of \c S<small>TXXL</small> performance features:
- transparent support of multiple disks
- variable block lengths
- overlapping of I/O and computation
- prevention of OS file buffering overhead
- algorithm pipelining
- utilization of multiple processor cores for internal computation
