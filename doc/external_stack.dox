/*! \page external_stack stxxl::stack

The \c S<small>TXXL</small> provides an I/O-efficient stack implementation stxxl::stack as the perhaps simplest external memory data structure. 
\c S<small>TXXL</small> stacks are last in first out (LIFO), i.e. the element on top is the element added (pushed) most recently. 
To access elements below, the overlying elements have to be popped. The basic idea is to buffer the top k elements (k <= 2B) in internal memory,
If the buffers get empty on a number of removal calls, one block is brought from the external memory to the buffers.
Therefore at least B removals are required to make one I/O reading a block. Insertions cause no I/Os until the internal buffers full up.
If this case, one has make extra space and the first B elements are written to the disk. Thus a block write happens only after at least B insertions.
Consequently, the amortized I/O complexity for push and pop stack operations is O(1/DB).

\c S<small>TXXL</small> library contains four different variants of stacks, each implementation is specialized for a certain access pattern:

1. \b normal_stack is a general purpose implementation which is the best if the access pattern to the stack is an irregular mix of 
push'es and pop's, i.e. the stack grows and shrinks without a certain rule.

2. \b grow_shrink stack is a stack that is optimized for an access pattern where the insertions are (almost) not intermixed with the removals, and/or vice versa,
the removals are (almost) not intermixed with the insertions. In short, the stack first grows to its maximal size, then shrinks, then grow again and so on, a pattern which can be described by \f$(push^{r_i}, push^{r_j})^k\f$ with \f$1 \leq j \leq k\f$ and large values for \f$r_i\f$ and \f$r_j\f$.

3. \b grow_shrink2 stack is a "grow-shrink" stack that allows the use of common prefetch and write buffer pools. 
   The pools are shared between several "grow-shrink" stacks.

4. \b migrating stack is a stack that migrates from internal memory to external memory when its size exceeds a certain threshold (determined by parameter migrating_critical_size)
   
To make use of stxxl::stack, one can use the generator template stxxl::STACK_GENERATOR which expects the parameters from left to right as shown in the table below.
