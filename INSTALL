QUICK INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR POSIX COMPATIBLE SYSTEMS

* Extract the tarball and change into the stxxl root directory.

* Adjust make.settings.gnu (or create make.settings.local and set the
  override values there) to match your local setup, especially consider
  the following variables:

  - STXXL_ROOT: the absolute path to the extracted STXXL sources
  - USE_BOOST and BOOST_ROOT: if you want to use the Boost libraries
  - MCSTL_BASE: if you want to use the MCSTL library
  - COMPILER: if you want to use a non-default compiler

* Compile the library:

  - without mcstl:    make library_g++
  - with mcstl:       make library_g++_mcstl

* Compile the test programs (optional)

  - without mcstl:    make tests_g++
  - with mcstl:       make tests_g++_mcstl
